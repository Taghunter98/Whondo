Masters Final Project, web application for finding properties through a prompt based system.

### For the Examiner
Project consists of the following structure:

-  __init__.py  -> main point of entry for flask app
- database     -> database connection module
-  property     -> property management module
-  search_engine  -> search engine module
- security       -> security module
-  static        -> frontend including assets
    - frontend
    - components
    - imports.js
    - pages
    - globalstyle.css
    - icons
- templates    -> static html templates
- tests        -> Python unit tests module
- users        -> user account management module
-  utilities    -> general utilities module

All Python code is well documented and includes explanations for functions as well as return types. All Python code is type hinted which should make reviewing it easier.

For the JavaScript, it is less documented but structured into components using a custom framework.
